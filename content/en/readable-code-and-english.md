## TL;DR

- Code is written for future readers—your teammates, your future self, and even AI—so clarity matters more than cleverness.
- Choosing clear English names nudges you to research vocabulary, turning everyday coding into language practice.
- Reading *The Art of Readable Code* naturally builds the desire to write clearer code.
  - As a result, reading *The Art of Readable Code* boosts your English skills.

## Code assumes someone will read it

A program is rarely "write once and forget." You will revisit it months later, collaborators will debug it, and AI tools will analyze it. When names and structures convey intent instantly, everyone saves time and avoids mistakes.

Think of names as short messages. Labels like `data1` hide meaning, while `pendingUsers` tells the next reader exactly what to expect.

## Naming doubles as English training

Using natural English is the best way to give code meaningful names. Romanized Japanese often confuses global teammates and future contributors.

Suppose you need to represent a list of users waiting for approval. Brainstorming phrases like `pendingUsers` or `unapprovedAccounts` pushes you to explore related vocabulary. Because the words are tied to a real task, they stick far better than flashcard memorization.

## Learn the basics with *The Art of Readable Code*

*The Art of Readable Code* (published in Japanese as 『リーダブルコード』) is a concise guide to writing code that communicates. Each chapter covers a small habit—naming, comments, decomposing functions—making it approachable for beginners.

As you read, you internalize the question, "How can I help the next reader?" That mindset naturally leads you to refine English names and look up better phrasing, reinforcing both coding and language skills.
